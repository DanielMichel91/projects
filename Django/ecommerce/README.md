# Ecommerce Shop Project

This project is an ecommerce shop built by Dennis Ivy. You can find the tutorial playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-51WBLyFTg0omnamUjL1TCVov7yDTRng).

## Usage

To use this project, you need to have Django installed. If you haven't installed Django yet, you can do so by running:

```
pip install django
```

Once Django is installed, navigate to the project folder where the `manage.py` file is located. To run the server on your local machine, use the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

To add products to the shop, you have the option to create an admin user. To create a superuser, run the following command:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your credentials. Once you've created the superuser, you can log in to the admin interface via your localhost. The admin interface can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. From there, you can manage and add products through the GUI.
